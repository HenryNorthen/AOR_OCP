# Analyzing the Ammonia Oxidation Reaction (AOR) using the Open Catalyst Project (OCP)

Ammonia (NH₃) is an appealing alternative to hydrogen for fuel cells and energy production. Hydrogen storage requires compression to extremely high pressures or cooling to very low temperatures, whereas ammonia remains liquid at room temperature under just 9 bar of pressure, making it easier and more affordable to store. Additionally, ammonia is already the second-most-produced chemical globally due to its widespread use in fertilizers, meaning production, transportation, and storage infrastructures are already well-developed.

Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have appeared commercially but have largely failed, primarily because of the challenging infrastructure requirements. Hydrogen refueling stations cost millions to build due to intense storage conditions, resulting in limited availability. Consumers are reluctant to purchase vehicles they must drive considerable distances to refuel, leading manufacturers to abandon hydrogen vehicle development.
Without these infrastructure barriers, hydrogen vehicles could have been far more successful. Ammonia offers higher energy density than hydrogen, along with significantly simpler storage and transportation. These characteristics position ammonia as an excellent candidate for fuel cell applications, where it can be oxidized cleanly into nitrogen gas and water without carbon emissions or harmful byproducts. Passenger vehicles are only a part of the potential applications; opportunities in shipping and industrial power production.

However, the Ammonia Oxidation Reaction currently suffers from slow reaction kinetics with existing catalysts, which typically rely on expensive precious metals. These catalysts are also susceptible to poisoning by nitrogen-containing intermediates—adsorbates that bind to the catalyst surface and block active sites—reducing their efficiency. Resolving these catalytic challenges is essential before ammonia fuel cells can be successfully commercialized.

For over a year, we have been running and interpreting adsorption energy calculations using the Open Catalyst Project, a project by Facebook AI Research that uses machine learning models to approximate Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations; a quantum mechanical approach for modeling electron behavior in molecules and solids. In doing so, OCP shortens computation times from days to minutes while maintaining relatively high levels of accuracy. This enables a new paradigm in electrocatalyst discovery: high-throughput computation first, followed by experimental validation.

We have screened the 11,000+ materials supported by OCP, running calculations between them and various adsorbates involved in the AOR. By doing this, we’ve developed a macroscopic view of the reaction thermodynamics and compiled adsorption energies for the 170 most promising materials across 15 adsorbates. From this, we narrowed the list to a few select materials with theoretically comparable performance to platinum-group metals, while being much more abundant in nature. Furthermore, we’ve identified structural trends among promising catalysts and found ways to potentially predict reaction pathways and product selectivity directly from adsorption energies.

We hope to begin experimental work based on the findings of these calculations in the near future.
